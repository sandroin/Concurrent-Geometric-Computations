# Concurrent-Geometric-Computations
This code defines classes and functions related to geometric shapes such as Trapezoids, Rectangles, and Squares, and then it utilizes concurrent programming techniques (threads and processes) to compute the areas of a large number of shapes efficiently. The program uses, thread-based concurrency (with ThreadPoolExecutor), process-based concurrency (with ProcessPoolExecutor) and their mixture to compute the areas of geometric shapes efficiently. The goal of the program is to observe the efficiency of the different methods. The code measures and prints the time taken for each approach to compute the areas of shapes, facilitating performance comparison between sequential, threaded, and multiprocessed implementations. The code demonstrates that for small inputs, the straightforward sequential method outperforms concurrent approaches. However, when dealing with large inputs, multiprocessing with threads emerges as the most efficient option in terms of computation time.
